CORE VAADIN STYLES

This theme contains only those styles that all Vaadin applications must always have in order to function properly, like layout styles (excluding spacing and margin sizes).

Anything that is subjective to taste (sizing, fonts, colors, cursors, etc), should be not be here.

NOTE: Applications are not required to be usable with this theme, they should merely start and lay out components approximately in their correct places.
